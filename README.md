## HOW TO USE ##

Download python 3.8.

Make an application at https://discord.com/developers/applications.

Name it and give it a profile picture if you want to.

Go to the bot section and create a bot.

Go to the OAuth2 section and select "Bot".

Scroll down to the bot permissions and select the permissions you want it to have. (permissions necessary for it to work are "Read Messages", "Send messages", and "Mention Everyone", but, if you're lazy, just select "Administrator".

Copy the link generated above the permissions area and search it. 

Invite the bot as normal to a server of your choosing.

Go back to the "Bot" section and press "copy token".

Go to Python IDLE and replace the "INSERT TOKEN HERE" with the seemingly random assortment of characters that you have copied. 

Press F5.
